# gym_booker
 
This is a dynamic webscraper built using Python requests and selenium packages to be able to access Trumba Calendars and automate the process of booking gym slots for my university.

You can change the timings within the timings.txt to reflect the preferred slots you'd like. You'd also have to edit your personal details within the gym_booker.py to be able to book slots for yourself (assuming you're from SMU).
